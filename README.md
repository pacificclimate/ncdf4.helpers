# ncdf4.helpers

`ncdf4.helpers` is a collection of helpful R functions for working with netCDF files that conform to the [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/index.html). The CF Conventions define metadata needed to specify the spatial and temporal properties of a dataset and a description of what each variable represents. This library can be used in addition to [ncdf4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncdf4/index.html) to work with netCDF files that follow this standard.

## Using ncdf4.helpers

You can install `ncdf4.helpers` from CRAN within R:

```
install.packages("ncdf4.helpers")
library("ncdf4.helpers")
```

Help on the package or individual functions is available within R:

```
?ncdf4.helpers
?nc.get.time.series
```

## Updating ncdf4.helpers

Eventually much of this will be automated, but for now:

1. Update the version in `DESCRIPTION`
2. Regenerate the documentation by running roxygen::roxygenize("/path/to/library") with R
3. Add the following two lines to the `NAMESPACE` file generated by roxygen:
```
importFrom("stats", "na.omit")
importFrom("utils", "head", "tail")
```
4. Commit to github
5. If the github tests pass, you can build the new package with `R CMD build ncdf4.helpers` and upload to CRAN if relevant.
