0.3-7: MINOR: Disable a test that had begun failing on CRAN due to an update to system netCDF library updates on some operating systems.

0.3-5: MINOR: Update maintainer, test suite, and documentation. On the Debian OS, one of the tests returns some unexpected values, and is partially skipped.

0.3-4: MINOR: Add 'seconds' as a valid time value.

0.3-3: MAJOR: Import PCICt, which solves problems with nc.get.time.series.
       MINOR: Add parameter to nc.get.dim.bounds.var.list to get a list for a variable; add latitude_longitude to grid_mapping list; add functionality to return climatology_bounds for a time series upon request.

0.3-2: Modify rotated pole proj4 string to work with rgdal; clean up use of external packages to meet current R standards.

0.3-1: Clean up functions, add tests, incorporate documentation; initial release on CRAN.

0.2-7: Add tolerance to nc.is.regular.dimension.

0.2-6: Add functionality to nc.copy.atts to rename attributes while copying.

0.2-5: Fix bugs with nc.put.var.subset.by.axes, improve performance and memory usage of nc.get.var.subset.by.axes .

0.2-4: Add complementary function to nc.get.var.subset.by.axes (nc.put.var.subset.by.axes).

0.2-3: Modify nc.get.dim.axes to handle variables without any dimensions more gracefully; modify nc.get.var.subset.by.axes to hangle no-dimensions data.

0.2-2: Modify nc.get.dim.axes to give dim axes for all dims if no variable specified.

0.2-1: Add code to create a proj4 string given a NetCDF variable and file for several projection types.

0.1-8: Add code to retrieve an arbitrary subset of a variable by axis.

0.1-7: Add code to deal with true Gregorian calendars if desired.

0.1-6: Add code to copy attributes from one file/var to another file/var.

0.1-5: Add code to add bounds to timeseries returned if bounds are available.

0.1-4: Add 'dim.names' parameter to nc.get.dim.axes .

0.1-3: Add nc.get.climatology.bounds.var.list, make use of it in nc.get.variable.list .

0.1-2: Add support for forcing a proleptic gregorian calendar.

0.1-1: Initial version
